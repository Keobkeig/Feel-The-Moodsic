# Feel-The-Moodsic
As presented at BigRedHack's 2025 Makeathon, Feel-The-Moodsic is a neural network model that detects the song playing aloud and returns a color represented by the mood of the song in real-time. The model is trained on the [Spotify 2018 and 2019 Audio Features Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tomigelo/spotify-audio-features/code).
